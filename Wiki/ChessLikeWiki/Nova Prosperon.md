After the disaster of the [[Fungal Uprising]]. Most of the people from [[Solida Prosperon]] marched further east to different lands. After passing trough what's now known as [[Verdavalo]], and refusing to stop. The people continued to the distant mountains.

There they where fortunate enough to find the same quality of rock, which after proper inspection, proved to be free of the fungus in the previous sub region.
It is a common tourist attraction thanks to the great views in the mountains (and better economy).

*Prosperon = Prosperity(Esperanto)*
