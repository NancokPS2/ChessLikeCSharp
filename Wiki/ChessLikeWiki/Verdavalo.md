Between the mountainous terrains of [[Nova Prosperon]] and [[Solida Prosperon]]. There's a large valley splitting the region in 2. It is known for its long road that goes trough the entire sub region and the smaller ones that branch of to the not-as traveled parts of the woods.

Most of its inhabitants are the descendants of those that decided to settle down before ever reaching [[Nova Prosperon]].

*Verdavalo = Green valley (Esperanto)*
