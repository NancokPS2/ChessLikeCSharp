A giant jungle situated in the middle of the [[Dead Lands]]. 
Ironically, the jungle is the only thing that's not dead in the region. But it is called as such because most who venture are always marked up as dead.

It is home to some of the most deadly creatures, most of which have yet to be documented or probably even seen. However, most of the creatures in the jungle have evolved to avoid detection and efficiently process nutrients. Leading to an eerily quiet place. 
But when someone not native steps in, it is pretty much open season on them.

It is thought that the jungle sucks up all of the water of the [[Dead Lands]]. Causing [[the barrens]]
