The commonly used world maps depict the world split in a total of 5 main regions.

These essentially act as countries, for the most part. Altho some act more like categories for their [[Sub Region]]s. 

The regions are as follows:

- [[Teronova]]

- [[Dushe]]

- [[Dead Lands]]

- [[Independent Sub-Regions]]

- [[Rasembl√©]]
