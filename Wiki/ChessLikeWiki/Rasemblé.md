Fittingly, it is the largest of the regions, with a mix of many cultures and governments. It is common for its inhabitants to refer to anything outside of it as the outer lands.

When the first maps where being drawn, most of the populace of this now-region where actually completely detached from each other.

The first map drafts that where preserved show that where there's [[Rasemblé]] now. There used to be a complete mix of dozens of smaller regions.

Seeing as these regions where so numerous and yet so small. Maps started to consider these as part of the [[Independent Sub-Regions]]. Some of the parts of [[Rasemblé]] remained as such, while the ones that had more closer relations where given their current denomination.
With time, the members of the region grew closer together. It is debated if the decisions taking by cartographers had a big impact or not.
