Damage types:
- Melee: boosted by stats, higher potential
- Ranged: weapon dependant, good base damage, stunted by high defense and with lower accuracy at longer ranges
- Magic: ignores defense and accuracy (most of the time), typically low but reliable damage

Accuracy:
- Directly modifies the power of the effect (damage, healing, debuffs, etc)

Buffs/Debuffs:
- They come in tiers, abilities that affect status effects can only target specific tiers. The tier depends on how impactful the effect is
- Sources apply a certain power of the effect. If the applied power is lower than 1 (like 0.8) nothing happens, but the stack remains and adds up to the next attempt.
- Attempting to remove an status effect that's below 0 will reduce the stack by half but won't remove it

Enemy Types:
- Fire: strong single targets with powerful AoE, may merge to become stronger
- Ice/water: split into more units as the fight goes on, one shot protection
- Earth: strong attacks and resilient but slow, less numbers
- Undead: healing significantly reduced, more tools for revival
- Wind: weak but unusally defensive by having means to deal with different damage sources and with plenty of AoE. Felling them requires persistence and long term strategies
- Light: attacks ignore defenses and reduce health by set amounts

Maps and Terrain:
- Field wide effects affect all units and may change the way an engagement must be aproached

Status effects:  
Tier 1:
- Negative:
	- Poison: reduces health of the target by 8%/power of the target's max health 
	- Bleeding: lowers max health of the target by 5%/power per turn, max health lost this way recovers at a rate of 2.5% per turn once the status has been cured
	- Blinded: accuracy becomes capped at a percentage equal to: 80 - (power * 10). e.x. a power of 2 would cap the target's accuracy to 60%
	- Staggered: delays the next turn by 33%/power 
	- Weaken: lowers all of the user's main stats by 10%/power
- Positive:
	

Tier 2:
- Negative:
	- Stunned: can't perform actions, movement halved. Duration is equal to power
	- Pinned: Can't move but can act. Duration is equal to power
	- Blank: abilities disabled. Duration is equal to power
	- Sluggish: energy regeneration reduced by 33%/power
	- Anti-life: prevents healing, un-dead felled under this effect can't be raised again

Tier 3:
- Negative:
	- Withering: reduce max health and energy of the target by 8%/power until the victim is felled
	- Death: after 5 - power turns, the target is felled (bosses take twice as long for the effect to happen)
