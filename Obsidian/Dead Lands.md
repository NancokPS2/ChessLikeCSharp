A vastly barren land. Deemed to have little of value.

If anyone even lives here, chances are they are one of the most high-class fugitives or lunatics.   

Most theorize that a source of dark forces lives in the heart of the region. But this has yet to be proven.

It contains the following [[Sub Region]]s, born from common knowledge of its different landscapes.

- [[The barrens]]
- [[Dead Jungle]]
- [[Underworld]]
