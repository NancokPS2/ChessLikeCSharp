Part of the [[Local Rangers]]
By pure bad luck, the [[Main Character]] is found by a [[unknown power]], that without asking, takes something invaluable from them.
The [[Main Character]] learns of the [[conflict]]. One in which their new-found power could tilt the conflict's fate.

An otherwise common folk which works their part on their [[MC Village]].

One day, wandering trough the [[woods]], they find an intriguing dancing light. Against their better judgement they inspect it, just to be surprised by a [[unknown power]].
