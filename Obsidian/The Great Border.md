A large swathe of land between [[Dushe]] and [[Rasemblé]]. That for political reasons, belongs to the [[Outskirts]].

This is a result of attempts from [[Dushe]] to take parts of [[Rasemblé]], before the region even got its name. 
When word got out of [[Dushe]]'s movement on the region, a militia formed on [[Rasemblé]] and fought back.

When the fighting started to reach larger scales, many powerful people of [[Rasemblé]] itself, even though not directly affected by the loss of land or the conflict, decided to threaten with joining the fight.

In a strange twist, [[Dushe]] themselves erected a perimeter to avoid any potential entry from [[Rasemblé]] . Regardless of the lack of interest.
