For one reason or another, with the amount of combat required at any given time, many end up in what's known as a [[Combat Job]].
Originally referred to as a "soldier", the term fell out of favor with the emergence of more unique styles of combat or aid. Most of these master more than just regular combat, but incorporate some techniques from other sources magical:

- [[Phoenix Warrior]] (Melee with AoE and HP costs)
- [[Celestial Priest]] (Healer)
- [[Wisp Tamer]] (Summoner) 
- [[Vagrant]] (Jack of all trades)
- [[Artificer]] (Item specialist)
- [[Mimic Witch]] (Blue mage)
