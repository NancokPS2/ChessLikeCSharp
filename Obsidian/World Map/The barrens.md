A large savanna that surrounds the edges of the [[Dead Lands]].

The only thing that grows here is a dry and pale grass with no nutritional value.

There's also a species of tree that dies shortly after sprouting, producing sparse but dominant dead trees.

The soil is equally frail, being made out of loose dirt and sand.


Due to the lack of resources. Venturing into the central parts of the [[Dead Lands]] requires a lot of preparation and resources, which paired with the terrible terrain, dissuades anyone without the resources for the needed preparation.
