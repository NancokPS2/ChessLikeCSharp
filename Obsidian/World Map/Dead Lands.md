A vastly barren land. Deemed to have little of value.

If anyone even lives here, chances are they are one of the most high-class fugitives or lunatics.   

Most theorize that a source of dark forces lives in the heart of the region. But this has yet to be proven.

It is divided by 2 biomes.

## Dead Jungle
A giant jungle situated in the middle of the [[Dead Lands]]. 
Ironically, the jungle is the only thing that's not dead in the region. But it is called as such because most who venture are always marked up as dead.

It is home to some of the most deadly creatures, most of which have yet to be documented or probably even seen. However, most of the creatures in the jungle have evolved to avoid detection and efficiently process nutrients. Leading to an eerily quiet place. 
But when someone not native steps in, it is pretty much open season on them.

It is thought that the jungle sucks up all of the water of the [[Dead Lands]]. Causing [[Dead Lands]]

### Underworld
The name was born as both a joke and superstition. This sub region's existence is widely doubted.

The Underworld is supposed to be a cave system nearly as big as the entirety of the [[Dead Lands]]. Nothing is known about what could be in its supposed depths

### The Barrens
A large savanna that surrounds the edges of the [[Dead Lands]].

The only thing that grows here is a dry and pale grass with no nutritional value.

There's also a species of tree that dies shortly after sprouting, producing sparse but dominant dead trees.

The soil is equally frail, being made out of loose dirt and sand.


Due to the lack of resources. Venturing into the central parts of the [[Dead Lands]] requires a lot of preparation and resources, which paired with the terrible terrain, dissuades anyone without the resources for the needed preparation.
