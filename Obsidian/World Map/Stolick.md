[[Dushe]]'s capital and main fortress.
This district was made as both a refuge for its leaders and as an evacuation zone in case of emergency. It is equipped with enough infrastructure to house and feed a large population for a considerable amount of time. 
It is the smallest sub region of Dushe and in times of peace, its space is re-purposed for non-sensitive administrative work and events.
No foreigners are allowed in this district for security reasons. And native citizens must go trough strict security checkpoints to enter.
