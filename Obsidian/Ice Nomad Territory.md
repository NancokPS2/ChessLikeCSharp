The far south and north of the land have a few spots where the neighboring regions don't reach. Mostly due to the amount of mountainous terrain.

The sub region gets its name from its usual population which consists of people roaming the cold lands. Since the terrain is so poor for construction and farming, it is the only real way to live in these areas. 
Some [[Race]]s accustomed to the cold are specially fond of them.
