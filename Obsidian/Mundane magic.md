There's many commonly practiced spells that are used for every-day tasks. Some of this have evolved to also work on combat situations.
## Common
These are the most likely to come naturally to people. Mostly due to their nature.
- **Memory ghost**: By using an item in a specific manner with the proper incantations, it is possible to use it in an identical manner without having to actually be present or even touch the item. This is useful for repetitive and simple tasks since the ghost cannot perform much finer motions.
- **Sparking/Fiery emissions**: The ability to spew fire or even lighting from one's body is another common one. The mere energy of the body can be amplified and manifested several times over. But preventing self harm from its usage becomes harder the more intense it becomes.
- **Wind control**: With everyone mastering breathing since birth, this one tends to manifest by itself even if in very weak forms. Only years of specialized dedication can allow someone to handle this properly.
## Rare
These require large amounts of practice to pull off and are usually more sophisticated versions of other kinds of spells.
- **Water summoning**: An arduous and long ritual that creates water from thin air. One of the most time consuming kind. Often done in groups, this magic is capable of creating water in front of the very caster's eyes. Commonly done with several casters around a large recipient. And only ever done in times of drought.
- **Flesh transmutation**: modifying a living being can vary greatly on degree of effect, success and consequences. The most common kind is the ability to harden the skin or close wounds. But more legendary versions exist of people changing their entire bodies into someone else, or something else entirely.  
- **Healing**: Similar to flesh transmutation, healing spells are distinguished by not simply removing wounds, but also soothing the pain and performing other more delicate restoration processes, like restarting a stilled heart.
