[[Poxt]] are the most common in the [[Ice Nomad Territory]] and are known for their predisposition for trading. 

## Appearance
Small and covered in white and grey fur with long floppy ears and noses the size of their eyes. They have an easy time camouflaging in snowy weather.

## History
Most of their history has been lost to time, simply due to a lack of motivation to record their lives.
It is a tradition to at least once in a lifetime, to return to an isolated place with the most valuable item one can find.
Because it is believed that the value of the item should be enough to attract a person anywhere it is taken. Managing to find an item that yields that kind of results is considered a huge achievement in their culture.
