## Summary
Tall lagomorphs with infamously stubborn temper. They are known for travelling long distances before settling in for life. [[Vojiklo]]'s rarely develop a sense of "home" during their childhood and are quick to pack up and leave in search of what they want from in life even at very young ages. However, once settled. They rarely travel again.

## Appearance
[[Vojiklo]]'s have digitigrade legs and ears coming out of the higher part of their skull. With a gaunt face and a nose that blends into the skull seamlessly.

## History
[[Vojiklo]] have well documented history from all around the world. It is estimated that 40% of all written history has come from their kind. 
Due to their propensity for travelling. Many small communities, kingdoms and settlements have risen and fallen over time. Most of the time due to the population leaving.
Due to the difficulty at forming large groups. Their presence rarely left any long lasting effect and few notorious events happened over their history with them as the center piece.  

> Vojilo comes from the Esperanto "vojagante" and "kuniklo" (travelling rabbit)
