A mythical language that's not well known. WIth some traces of it found in excavation sites.

[[Aperion]] had used the language to a limited degree as their subterranean villages contain plenty of scriptures using it. While it is easy to form a connection between them and the language, it seems most of their relation to it comes from finding and worshiping the writings. Their interpretation of it has not been confirmed any more than other theories.
