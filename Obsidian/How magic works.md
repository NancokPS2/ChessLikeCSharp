Magic is a mundane word in [[Continent]]
Exercising one's will over the world is as common as it is unknown. With many developing some sort of supernatural talent at some point in their lives.
These play a big role in [[Mundane magic|every day life]]

It is tought that it simply works by channeling one's will onto the world. The more aligned it is with other's wills, the easier it is to manifest.
Magic still is person to person, and repeating the same steps as others does not guarantee it will work everytime.

Many of the greater magics often allow for, or even require several participants, which don't always need to be proficient with it. Just the participation of others is capable of boosting a spell.
This is why it is tought that magic itself is a manifestations of everyone's collective will to change fate. The same way many supernatural creatures and forces of nature operate.

The more easily a spell comes to someone, usually the safer it is. The more legendary and/or extreme spells tend to be more dangerous, regardless of expertise. With more grave possible side-effects should they be miss used or performed wrongly.
