Occurring in the sub region of [[Solida Prosperon]]. A species of fungus that had long since rendered inert due to being encased in rock sprang back to life thanks to the humidity of the outside.
This led to fungus to grow sporadically and out of control, and to cause people a dangerous but not outright lethal illness.
Eventually, the fungus started growing spikes and even moving on its own at others presence. And it wasn't long until commonly traveled routes started to be specifically blocked by the fungus, as if it was alive.

However, just as it is believed happened the first time, all fungi exposed to the outside world perished eventually. But there's still pockets of them in the mountains, which has led to an increase in operation costs and for the entire sub region to suffer a decline in population.
