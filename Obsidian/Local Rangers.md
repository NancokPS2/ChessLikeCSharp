A world wide organization focused on training volunteers for public service.
The organization lives on mostly trough tradition. As rangers will often embark on missions to setup new training centers around the world.
These centers are funded trough variety of means. Sometimes they are government sponsored and others they are a community effort.

They have only 2 rules to qualify as rangers:
- Act to the benefit of the community.
- All resources are to be used for others first, and the rangers second.

Other than those, rangers are allowed to use any means for their objectives. With people from all walks of life providing their own expertise. Be it in combat of several types or simple things like feeding those in need.
