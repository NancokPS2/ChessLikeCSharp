Among the world there are several factions. Each with their own hostilities and alliances as well as their own goals and ideologies.

### Mechanics
[[Unit]]s can define to which faction they belong, using an identifier to do so. 
Factions only keep track of relations with other factions and an [[inventory]] which all of its members have access to.
