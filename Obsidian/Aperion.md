A race of beings that shine brightly, literally.
[[Aperion]] have their own phonetics as they are incapable of making the same sounds most other humanoids can. Even if someone where to learn their language, reproducing it would be difficult. As such most of them learn common languages to better fit in.
Despite their shine, they are very susceptible to sun-burns so they take extra care of covering themselves in clothes from top to bottom. 

## Appearance
They posses a membranous and almost gelatinous "skin" that could be confused for a slime. Inside of that skin they have a strong bioluminescence as if they had a miniature sun in their interior. 
Their skin is very slightly translucent, and if someone where to watch intently, they could see their interior filled with nebulous gas.

## History
[[Aperion]] where first found in caves living fairly tranquil lives. Their innate glow and limited nutritional requirements gave them little need for tools and as such rendered them rather primitive in terms of technology. Their status as an intelligent race took many decades to solidify as a result.

> Aperion comes from the Esperanto "Aperi" (Emerge)
